### 2048 
Using ChatGPT, we were able to create a funcitonal 2048 game.
1. Binary Shifting - We stored numbers in binary and used Javascript Binary Shifting (e.g. <<) to handle the powers of two.
2. By using for loops, we can iterate through all the rows and columns in the game board and update based on the inputs
3. Using functions, the different results of each input key can be emulated

### Styling
Using .scss files, we were able to customize different aspects of the style
1. Page animation: Fade in transition for every page
2. Coloring: For the 2048 board game, we were able to color the boxes to any color we wanted

### Plans for the future
1. Add more to the styling to customize the frontend
2. Personalize the design of the page
