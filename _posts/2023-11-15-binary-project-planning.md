### Data Compression using Binary
- Compress the data of a file using binary
  - Use RLE Compression for the file
- Get the Uint8 array value of each pixel and convert to binary
- If a value is repeated, compress into one "spot" on the compressed data array
  - Compresses all consecutive repeat values into one value pair
