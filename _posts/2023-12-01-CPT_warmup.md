#### Algorithm Development

Our project demonstrates the following algorithm development learning objectives:

- CRD-2.B: Explain how a program or code segment functions.
- AAP-2.E.b: Evaluate expressions that use relational operators (<, >, ==, etc).
- AAP-2.F.b: Evaluate expressions that use logic operators (and, or, not).
- AAP-2.H.b: Determine the result of conditional statements.
- AAP-2.J: Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language.
- AAP-2.K.b: Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements.
- AAP-2.L: Compare multiple algorithms to determine if they yield the same side effect or result.
- AAP-2.M.a: Create algorithms.
- AAP-2.M.b: Combine and modify existing algorithms.

#### Errors and Testing

Our project addresses errors and testing learning objectives:

- CRD-2.I.a: Identify the error.
- CRD-2.I.b: Correct the error.
- CRD-2.J: Identify inputs and corresponding expected outputs or behaviors that can be used to check the correctness of an algorithm or program.

#### Data and Procedural Abstraction

Our project employs data and procedural abstraction:

- AAP-1.D.a: Develop data abstraction using lists to store multiple elements.
- AAP-1.D.b: Explain how the use of data abstraction manages complexity in program code.
- AAP-2.O.a: Write iteration statements to traverse a list.
- AAP-2.O.b: Determine the result of an algorithm that includes list traversals.
- AAP-3.B: Explain how the use of procedural abstraction manages complexity in a program.

# Binary to Decimal Converter - Warm-Up Project

## Project Overview

As a warm-up for the upcoming Create Performance Task (CPT) projects, we will implement a Binary to Decimal Converter. This project will serve as a foundation for the skills and requirements needed for the main Binary to 2048 project.

### Warm-Up Project Objectives

1. **Binary to Decimal Conversion:**
   - Create a simple program that takes a binary input and converts it to its decimal equivalent.
   - Display the binary input and the resulting decimal output.

2. **Basic Frontend Styling with SASS:**
   - Implement basic styling for the user interface using SASS.
   - Focus on styling the input form and result display.

#### CRUD Operations in Frontend

Implement basic frontend functionality:
   - Clear Button: Clears the input field.
   - Reset Button: Resets the result display.

#### Introduction to APIs and Database Tables

While not directly implemented in this warm-up, discuss the concept of APIs and how they can connect frontend and backend elements. Introduce the idea of database tables for storing and managing data.

### Deliverables

1. **Code Implementation:**
   - Provide well-documented code for the binary to decimal conversion.
   - Include the SASS styling code.
