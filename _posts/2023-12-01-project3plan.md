Phase: Binary to Decimal Conversion
Objective:
Implement a binary-to-decimal conversion function and create a basic user interface.

Tasks:

## Binary-to-Decimal Conversion:

Research and understand the binary-to-decimal conversion algorithm.
Implement a conversion function in the language of choice (e.g., JavaScript).
Test the conversion function with different binary inputs to ensure accuracy.
Basic User Interface:

Create a simple HTML form for binary input.
Implement a display area for showing the decimal output.
Use minimal styling with inline CSS for a clean appearance.
User Interaction:

Develop JavaScript functions to handle user input and update the display.
Include a "Convert" button to trigger the conversion process.
Deliverables:

Well-documented code for the binary-to-decimal conversion.
A basic HTML file for user input and result display.
Simple JavaScript functions for user interaction.

## Data Compression:
Get a user input image from the website. From there, figure out a way to compress the data using binary and return the compressed data. Use the console to show the data, and make sure different file types are supported. 

## Binary Art
Visually show the binary values using some sort of art system. Currently, the plan is to use lightbulbs to show multiple rows of binary values. By changing the binary values on each row, the output of the lightbulbs at the end can be changed and seen.
